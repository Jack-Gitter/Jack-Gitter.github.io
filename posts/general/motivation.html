            I like to develop and implement a lot of different backend projects and protocols. Backend development is not that easy to show off, 
            so I figured I'd write about it to track my learning progress, and also use it as a reference tool since I'm bound to forget some of this stuff. 
            It's meant to be academic, but also written in a way that doesn't take itself too seriously. The majority of the posts will be recounts 
            of recent coding efforts, with links to github repositories for references. Some posts might be different.
