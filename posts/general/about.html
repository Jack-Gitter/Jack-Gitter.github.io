                My name is Jack Gitter, and I graduated from Northeastern University with a B.S. in computer science from 
                Northeastern University's Boston campus in 2023. Since then, my professional focus has been on backend web development,
                primarily working with NodeJS, but I'm also comfortable in a number of languages such as Golang, Java, and others. 
                Some of my hobbies include: soccer, going to the gym, running, and cooking
