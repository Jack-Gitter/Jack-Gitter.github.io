            <h1>First Neovim Plugin</h1>
            <p class="date">April 24, 2025</p>

            I've been using neovim for quite some time now, and something that I strive to achieve with my configuration is completeness. For coding related
            activities, I don't want to have to leave the environment and open up another application. Plugins such as 
            <a href='https://github.com/tpope/vim-dadbod'>nvim-dadbod</a> and <a href='https://github.com/mistweaverco/kulala.nvim'>kulala</a> have helped me 
            in these efforts by giving my a built in database client with nvim-dadbod, and HTTP (and more) client with kulala. Now my plugin is nothing 
            close to these, although it did help me stay within neovim for something I do quite often. As apart of my development workflow when creating a 
            new feature, I typically list out all of the steps, requirements, and other important aspects of the feature in a text document of sorts so that
            I'm able to focus on one thing at a time, and feel at ease because all my thoughts are written down already which pertain to later implementation
            details. My solution was typically to use the Notes app on MacOS which required me to leave neovim. I figured this would be a great time to learn 
            something new and solve my problem at the same time. The result of this is Todo.nvim, a plugin made by me to take persistant notes across neovim 
            sessions! The usage and implementation is quite basic, writing information to a file and displaying it with a markdown renderer in a floating window, 
            but I learned a lot along the way and use it quite frequently.
            

            <div class='todo-img-container'>
                <img src="./todo.nvim.png">
            </div>


            An example configuration using lazy package manager is below


<pre class="prettyprint lang-lua"> return {
    'Jack-Gitter/todo.nvim',
    dependencies = {
        'MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim',
    },
    opts = {
        fullpath = vim.env.HOME .. '/.config/todo.md',
    },
    config = function(_, opts)
        local todo = require('todo')
        todo.setup(opts)
    end,
    keys = { '<leader>td' }
}</pre>



        <p>
        Overall, I learned alot about the lua api within neovim, and despite it being a small plugin has helped me feel more emmersed in my environment.
