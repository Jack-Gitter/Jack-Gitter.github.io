            The motivation for writing this blog is that I like to develop and implement a lot of different backend projects and protocols. 
            Backend development is not that easy to show off, so I figured I'd write about it in the most basic way possible to track my learning progress
            and also as a reference since I'm bound to forget some of this stuff.
