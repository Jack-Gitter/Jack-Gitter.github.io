            <p>
            Authentication and authorization are two critical parts of any software which has a notion of a "user". Authentication allows a user or system to prove 
            that they are who they say they are, and authorization gives an entity access to protected resources. 
            The combination of these two principals allows for complex and robust user management, and a plethora of protocols and jargon to go along with it. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Oauth</h2>

                <h3>What is it for</h3>
                Oauth is an authorization framework built to allow one application to view a users information from another application. It is not concerned with who 
                is making a request for information, but only if that request is allowed or not. Here are some important terms that oauth
                defines

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        access token: A string which is sent with requests to a resource server. The resource server uses the access token to determine whether or not the 
                        request is valid. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        refresh token: A string which is used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        opaque tokens: Access tokens which are not decipherable by the client application. They only "mean" something to the server
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JWT: A token format which is decipherable by the client application. The client application is able to view what access is defined for the provided token. 
                        A JWT is also signed, and not encrypted in any way. The signature helps the server know that the token has not been tampered with in or before transit
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Authorization server: The server which issues access tokens, refresh tokens, etc
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Resource Server: The server which contains protected resources
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Client: The server requesting protected resources
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Local vs Provided Access Tokens</h2>
                <h3>provided from auth server directly are provided access tokens </h3>
                <h3>Google access token login example with code</h3>
                
            <h2>Idps</h2>
                <h3>what are they, why are they useful</h3>
                <h3>different ways to integrate</h3>
                    headless frontend
                    frontend
                    backend 
                <h3>Sytch code example with code</h3>
            <h2>Authentication</h2>
                used to prove a user is who they say they are
                <h3>Authencation vs authorization</h3>
                used for SSO. The main difference is that an access token is typically used by an app to request resources. authentication is mainly for users, so that
                they can be signed in to third party apps and interact with them from the browser
            <h2>OIDC</h2>
                <h3>what is it</h3>
                    extension of oauth
                    used for authentication
                    id token returned
                    not meant to be sent to an auth server
                    proves that a user is who they say they are
                    useful for SSO, Idps can talk directly to auth servers to verify ID tokens to authenticate users
                <h3>Google OIDC login code example with code</h3>
                    can sometimes be sent to local server to generate JWT 
                <h3>SAML</h3>
                same as oauth, more mature protocl but same principals.
