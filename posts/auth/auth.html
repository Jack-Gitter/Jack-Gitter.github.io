            <p>
            Authentication and authorization are two critical parts of any software which has a notion of a "user". Authentication allows a user or system to prove 
            that they are who they say they are, and authorization gives an entity access to protected resources. 
            The combination of these two principals allows for complex and robust user management, and a plethora of protocols and jargon to go along with it.

            <h2>Oauth</h2>

                <h3>What is it for</h3>
                Only authorization

                <h3>General Oauth Flow and terms</h3>
                    claims
                    access token
                    refresh token
                    redirect url
                    auth server
                    nothing about who I am, only access/authorization concerned
                    opaque vs non-opaque tokens
                <h3>Specific Oauth Flow example no code. Code to come later</h3>

            <h2>Local vs Provided Access Tokens</h2>
                <h3>provided from auth server directly are provided access tokens </h3>
                <h3>Google access token login example</h3>
                
            <h2>Idps</h2>
                <h3>what are they, why are they useful</h3>
                <h3>different ways to integrate</h3>
                    headless frontend
                    frontend
                    backend 
                <h3>Sytch code example</h3>
            <h2>Authentication</h2>
                used to prove a user is who they say they are
                <h3>Authencation vs authorization</h3>
                used for SSO. The main difference is that an access token is typically used by an app to request resources. authentication is mainly for users, so that
                they can be signed in to third party apps and interact with them from the browser
            <h2>OIDC</h2>
                <h3>what is it</h3>
                    extension of oauth
                    used for authentication
                    id token returned
                    not meant to be sent to an auth server
                    proves that a user is who they say they are
                    useful for SSO, Idps can talk directly to auth servers to verify ID tokens to authenticate users
                <h3>Google OIDC login code example</h3>
                    can sometimes be sent to local server to generate JWT [SHOW CODE EXAMPLE]
                <h3>SAML</h3>
                same as oauth, more mature protocl but same principals. 
                <h3>IDP initiated SSO vs SP initiated SSO</h3>
                    example with keycloak and grafana
