            <p>
            Authentication and authorization are two critical parts of any software which has a notion of a "user". Authentication allows a user or system to prove 
            that they are who they say they are, and authorization gives an entity access to protected resources. 
            The combination of these two principals allows for complex and robust user management, and a plethora of protocols and jargon to go along with it. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Oauth</h2>

                <h3>What is it for</h3>
                Oauth is an authorization framework built to allow one application to view a users information from another application. It is not concerned with who 
                is making a request for information, but only if that request is allowed or not. Here are some important terms that oauth
                defines

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Access Token</b>: A string which is sent with requests to a resource server. The resource server uses the access token to determine whether or not the 
                        request is valid. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Refresh Token</b>: A string which is used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Opaque Tokens</b>: Access tokens which are not decipherable by the client application. They only "mean" something to the server
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>JWT</b>: A token format which is decipherable by the client application. The client application is able to view what access is defined for the provided token. 
                        A JWT is also signed, and not encrypted in any way. The signature helps the server know that the token has not been tampered with in or before transit
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Authorization Server</b>: The server which issues access tokens, refresh tokens, etc
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Resource Server</b>: The server which contains protected resources
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Client</b>: The server requesting protected resources
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Claims</b>: A description of what resources the access token gives the client access to
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>General Oauth Flow and terms</h3>

                In general, the oauth flow is initiated when an application needs access to a users resources. The client application redirects the user to the authorization server's sign-in page, where the user enters their credentials. During the sign-in process, the user is asked to accept a list of claims that the client application is requesting access to, on the users behalf. After the user successfully logs in and accepts these claims, they are redirected back to the client application, and the client application stores the access token for any necessary requests to the resource server

            <h2>Local vs Provided Access Tokens</h2>
                <h3>Provided access tokens</h3>
                Here, I am going to show a concrete example of an Oauth flow implemented with a simple express server and google's auth server.
                First, we have the user click the "Get Access Token" button, executes the following code. 

                <pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>
                export function redirect_to_google_acess_token_auth(req:Request, res:Response) {
                    const oauth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2({
                        clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID ?? '',
                        clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET ?? '',
                        redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/login/access/google'
                    }
                    );
                    const scopes = [
                      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/blogger',
                      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar',
                      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email',
                      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile'
                    ];
                    const url = oauth2Client.generateAuthUrl({
                      access_type: 'offline',
                      scope: scopes
                    });
                    res.redirect(url)
                }
                </pre>


This does a couple of things. Firstly, it initializes the google oauth client library for nodejs, which we provide a clientId and secret to. These values are generated when you create a project with google, and can be found in the dashboard. We also a redirectUri. This is how google knows to reidrect to our backend to finish the authorization process. We also define the claims that our application is requesting access to. These will be asked to be accepted during the auth process for the user. Finally, we use the google auth library to generate the url to the auth server login form, and redirect the user there. Once the user is redirected, they are asked to sign in with google normally. (screenshot here). After this, they are asked to accept the claism that we have defined, to give access to our application to those resources (screenshot here). After the user completes the auth process, our backend is hit and accepts an authorization code as a query parameter. Here is the code that handles the request from google

<pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>
export async function auth_access_token(req: Request, res: Response) {
    const code = req.query.code as string

    const oauth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2({
            clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID ?? '',
            clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET ?? '',
            redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/login/access/google'
        }
    );
    try {
        const { tokens } = await oauth2Client.getToken(code)
        const accessToken = tokens.access_token
        const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token
        const expiresIn = tokens.expiry_date ?? Date.now() + 60 * 60
        res.cookie('access_token', token)
        res.cookie('refresh_token', token)
        res.redirect('http://localhost:3001')
    } catch (e) {
        if (e instanceof Error) {
            res.status(400).send(e.message)
        } else {
            res.status(500).send('Something went wrong')
        }
    }
}
</pre>

You can see that we are processing the code from the query parameters, and initializing another version of the google oauth client. We are required to exchange this authorization code for an access token, which is also handled through another call of the client library. This Oauth flow is called the "authorization code flow", meaning that google does not directly provide us with an access token. Rather, we have to request one after recieveing the authorziation code. Finally, after getting both access and refresh tokens in exchange for our authorization code, The user is redirected to our frontend, and the backend sets the access token as a cookie. 


This code is a slight oversimplification of what is actually in the repository. In order to understand that, we must take a look at local access tokens.

            <h2>Authentication</h2>
                used to prove a user is who they say they are
                <h3>Authencation vs authorization</h3>
                used for SSO. The main difference is that an access token is typically used by an app to request resources. authentication is mainly for users, so that
                they can be signed in to third party apps and interact with them from the browser
            <h2>OIDC</h2>
                <h3>what is it</h3>
                    extension of oauth
                    used for authentication
                    id token returned
                    not meant to be sent to an auth server
                    proves that a user is who they say they are
                    useful for SSO, Idps can talk directly to auth servers to verify ID tokens to authenticate users
                <h3>Google OIDC login code example with code</h3>
                    can sometimes be sent to local server to generate JWT

                same as oauth, more mature protocl but same principals.
