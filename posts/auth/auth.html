            <h1>All About Auth</h1>
            <p class="date">September 24, 2025</p>

            <p>
            Authentication and authorization are two critical parts of any software which has a notion of a "user". Authentication allows a user or system to prove 
            that they are who they say they are, and authorization gives an entity access to protected resources. 
            The combination of these two principals allows for complex and robust user management, and a plethora of protocols and jargon to go along with it. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Oauth</h2>
            <p>
                Oauth is simply a open protocl which deals strictly with authroization. With Oauth, user are able to securly give applications access to their data on 
                third party services. For example, if a user logs into my music sharing website, I can ask them to log into spotify. While doing so, they will get a popup
                window describing the claims, or access that my application is requesting. If the user trusts my application, they will proceed with the login. After which 
                my application will recieve an access token, which must be appended to following requests to the spotify API to prove that I have access to the requested resources.
                The access token contains no information about who I am, it only is concerned with whether or not the user has granted me the proper scopes in 
                order to access the requested resources. In this scenario, spotify is what is known as the resource server, and the website I have made is the client app.
