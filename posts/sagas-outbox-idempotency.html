            <h1>How To Achieve Bulletproof Microservice Communication</h1>
            <p class="date">April 21, 2025</p>

            <p>
                During my short career so far, I've been exposted to a couple of different software architecture styles, but have only developed professionally 
                with one: microservices. Utilizing microserves in order to decouple a backend system into individually scalable and customizable applications is
                an extremely effective method to build sustainable infrastructure. Pair this with dockerized services, and an orchestration platform such as
                Kubernetes, and the stack is starting to feel pretty nice.
            </p>
            <p>
                With all these benefits, why would anyone ever decide to go in another direction? When utilizing microservices to build applications, 
                there are many more decisions that have to be made. How do we split the services? What protocol should be used to communicate between
                applications? And one of the most concerning of all: How is data integrity and consistency ensured? I want to focus on the last question, 
                as it's only a matter of time before as a microservice architecture using simple HTTP requests and isolated database transactions winds up in 
                an inconsistent state

            <h2>The Setup</h2>

            <p>
                Consider an ecommerce business where you can place orders for various different items, and have them shipped to you around the world.
                This business might have services for keeping track of orders, managing inventory, and validating shipping requirements. These can be called
                the Orders, Inventory, and Shipping microservices, respectively. When a user places an order, and Order record is entered in a pending state
                in the Orders database, and a message is sent to the Inventory service to check whether there is enough inventory of the particular product.
                The inventory then reserves stock in the product, and notifies the Orders service that there is ample supply for the specific order. Then,
                the Order service must reach out to the shipping service to validate that the customer is within the allowed shipping range for the specific 
                product. Only after which, can the Order service then notify the Inventory application to remove the stock permanently, and set the order status 
                to approved
