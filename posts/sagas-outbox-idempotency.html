            <h1>How To Achieve Bulletproof Microservice Communication</h1>
            <p class="date">April 21, 2025</p>

            <p>
                During my short career so far, I've been exposted to a couple of different software architecture styles, but have only developed professionally 
                with one: microservices. Utilizing microserves in order to decouple a backend system into individually scalable and customizable applications is
                an extremely effective method to build sustainable infrastructure. Pair this with dockerized services, and an orchestration platform such as
                Kubernetes, and the stack is starting to feel pretty nice.
            </p>
            <p>
                With all these benefits, why would anyone ever decide to go in another direction? When utilizing microservices to build applications, 
                there are many more decisions that have to be made. How do we split the services? What protocol should be used to communicate between
                applications? And one of the most concerning of all: How is data integrity and consistency ensured? I want to focus on the last question, 
                as it's only a matter of time before as a microservice architecture using simple HTTP requests and isolated database transactions winds up in 
                an inconsistent state
