            <h1>What is an Octopus</h1>
            <p class="date">April 19, 2025</p>
            <p>
            An Octopus in the NFL is when one player gets both the touchdown, and the two point conversion. This term was not coined by myself, but Mitch Goldich. 
            Please check out his <a href="https://www.mitchgoldich.com/octopus/">blog</a>, as without him this would not have been created.
