            <h1>What is an Octopus</h1>
            <p class="date">April 19, 2025</p>
            <p>
            An Octopus in the NFL is when one player gets both the touchdown, and the two point conversion. This term was coined by Mitch Goldich. 
            Please check out his <a href="https://www.mitchgoldich.com/octopus/">blog</a>, as without him this would not have been created.

            <h2>Twitter Bot</h2>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
                The intention is to tweet wehenver an NFL player gets an octopus, or whenever the indended receiver who dropped the ball was the player who scored the touchdown. 
                <a href="https://x.com/NFLOCTOBOT">@NFLOCTOBOT</a> is the handle.
            <p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            Creating a Twitter bot is pretty straightforward. After creating an account, you can go to the Twitter developer console to fetch all necessary
            tokens for auth, allowing access to api endpoints that are very well <a href="https://docs.x.com/x-api/introduction">documented</a>. 
            Because I used NodeJS, I was able to install a <a href="https://github.com/PLhery/node-twitter-api-v2">package</a> which aids in formatting the oauth 
            request parameters, along with some other helper functions which wrap requests. Overall after instantiating the client, 
            making requests was pretty straightforward
            
<pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>

export const twitterBaseUrl = `https://api.x.com/2`

export const getTwitterClient = async () => {
    return new TwitterApi({
      appKey: process.env.X_API_KEY as string,
      appSecret: process.env.X_API_KEY_SECRET as string,
      accessToken: process.env.X_ACCESS_TOKEN as string,
      accessSecret: process.env.X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET as string
    });
}

...

await twitterClient.post(`${twitterBaseUrl}/tweets`, body)
</pre>
                
            <p>
                Twitter rate limits posts to 17 per 24 hours on the free tier. I don't forsee this being a problem for tweeting about octopi.
