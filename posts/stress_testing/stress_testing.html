            <h1>How To Know if an Application Can Handle Production Traffic</h1>
            Many efforts are typically focused around unit, integration, and e2e tests to ensure that applications
            and APIs function as expected. These tests are extremely vital, as it ensures (for the most part) that there are no logical bugs
            within the application. One aspect that might be commonly overlooked is stress testing. With an upsege of traffic coming to an API, 
            how do developers know that their application can handle the extreme bandwidth that might come with the release of a production application?
            How can developers be sure that the application scales properly, and a system won't crash entirely? As well, some bugs, such as data races, 
            might not make themselves aparent under simple tests. Only when a high number of concurrent users are utilizing the system do these aches
            reveal themselves, with potential to cause catostrophic issues. In order to be sure of all of the aformentioned questions, stress testing
            can be implemented to be able to answer them with a high level of certainty.
