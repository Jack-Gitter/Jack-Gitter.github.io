            <h1>Integration Testing</h1>
            <p class="date">June 4, 2025</p>
            <p>
               In order to effectively test an application, it's crucial to know that it properly interacts with its dependencies. Verifying this can be hard 
               for a number of reasons. Frequently, all systems associated with an application are not owned by a single team. 
               Other times, changes are occuring fast and frequently, making it difficult to keep all the systems up to date. 
               It's important to have systems in place that ensure any application that has dependencies is integrated properly.
               This is applicable for all types of dependencies, whether it be an HTTP request to another microservice, 
               or a call to a database. If the microservice changes its endpoints, or the DBMS changes, it is important to know whether 
               the application can handle these changes, or if intervention is needed. Integeration testing allows for this process to be automated, 
               and ensure proper communication between an application and its dependencies. 
            </p>
            <h1>Test Containers</h1>
            <p>
                Using docker TestContainers, it is very easy to spin up instances of any dependency that is available to be run via docker. 
                In order to make sure that an application interacts with another properly, TestContainers can be used to manage an instance of another
                service for the duration of a test suite. TestContainers can spin up at the beginning of the suite, 
                allow for the tests to make real network connections to the resources, run real HTTP requests, and recieve accurate responses. 
                With this, no mocking is necessary, and greater certainty of application performance is achieved. 
                In the following examples, I'll use a postgres docker TestContainer in order to check the intergration of a 
                simple microservice with a database.
            </p>
            <h1>Homes Service</h1>
            <p>
                For the duration of the article, I'll be referncing code from a very basic NestJS project that I've developed. The sole purpose of this 
                service is to manage homes. This service can fetch all the homes that are currently stored in the database,
                fetch homes based on specific criteria, or "reserve" a home, which really doesn't do anything. The service is kept 
                brutally simple to focus on the testing.
                

    <pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>
@Controller('homes')
export class HomesController {
  constructor(private homesService: HomesService) {}

  @Get()
  public async getHomes() {
    return await this.homesService.getHomes();
  }

  @Get('/:city/:street/:zip')
  public async findHome(@Param() findHomeDto: FindHomeDTO) {
    return await this.homesService.findHome(
      findHomeDto.city,
      findHomeDto.street,
      findHomeDto.zip,
    );
  }

  @Post('/reservation/:city/:street/:zip')
  public async reserveHome(@Param() reserveHomeDto: ReserveHomeDTO) {
    return await this.homesService.reserveHome(
      reserveHomeDto.city,
      reserveHomeDto.street,
      reserveHomeDto.zip,
    );
  }
}</pre>

    <pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>
@Injectable()
export class HomesService {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(Home) private homesRepository: Repository<Home>,
  ) {}

  public async getHomes() {
    return await this.homesRepository.find();
  }

  public async findHome(city: string, street: string, zip: string) {
    const home = await this.homesRepository.findOneBy({
      street,
      city,
      zip,
    });
    if (home) {
      return home;
    } else {
      throw new NotFoundException('Home does not exist');
    }
  }

  public async reserveHome(city: string, street: string, zip: string) {
    const home = await this.homesRepository.findOneBy({
      street,
      city,
      zip,
    });
    if (!home) {
      throw new NotFoundException('Home does not exist');
    }
  }
}</pre>

            <h1>Databases and Running Migrations on TestContainers</h1>
            <p>
            Typeorm is used to manage database connections, entities, and migrations. In this application, there is 
             a singular homes entity 


<pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>
@Entity()
export class Home {
  constructor(
    street: string,
    city: string,
    zip: string,
    pricePerNight: number,
  ) {
    this.street = street;
    this.city = city;
    this.zip = zip;
    this.pricePerNight = pricePerNight;
  }

  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column({ type: 'varchar', name: 'street', nullable: false })
  public street: string;

  @Column({ type: 'varchar', name: 'city', nullable: false })
  public city: string;

  @Column({ type: 'varchar', name: 'zip', nullable: false })
  public zip: string;

  @Column({ type: 'int', name: 'price_per_night', nullable: false })
  public pricePerNight: number;

  toJson() {
    return {
      id: this.id,
      street: this.street,
      city: this.city,
      zip: this.zip,
      pricePerNight: this.pricePerNight,
    };
  }
}</pre>


<p>
In order to generate database tables, Typeorm was used to create migraitons automatically based off the entity
</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>
import { MigrationInterface, QueryRunner } from 'typeorm';

export class Init1748110788902 implements MigrationInterface {
  name = 'Init1748110788902';

  public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(
      `CREATE TABLE "home" ("id" SERIAL NOT NULL, "street" character varying NOT NULL, 
      "city" character varying NOT NULL, "zip" character varying NOT NULL, 
      "price_per_night" integer NOT NULL, 
      CONSTRAINT "PK_012205783b51369c326a1ad4a64" PRIMARY KEY ("id"))`,
    );
  }

  public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE "home"`);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
These migrations are run against the database upon startup, to ensure the database is in a consistent state and allows our application to interact with it properly. When running tests, the goal is to have the database schema identical to the schema that exists in the primary database. As such,
the same Typeorm migrations are ran on the TestContainers database to ensure consistency 
</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>
describe(HomesService.name, () =&gt {
  jest.setTimeout(60000);
  let homesService: HomesService;
  let container: StartedPostgreSqlContainer;
  let homeRepo: Repository&ltHome&gt;
  let datasource: DataSource;

  beforeAll(async () =&gt {
    container = await new PostgreSqlContainer()
      .withDatabase('contract_testing')
      .withUsername('postgres')
      .withPassword('postgres')
      .start();
  });

  afterAll(async () =&gt {
    await container.stop();
  });

  beforeEach(async () =&gt {
    const moduleRef = await Test.createTestingModule({
      imports: [
        TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
          type: 'postgres',
          host: container.getHost(),
          port: container.getPort(),
          username: container.getUsername(),
          password: container.getPassword(),
          database: container.getDatabase(),
          migrationsRun: true,
          entities: [Home],
          migrations: [Init1748110788902],
        }),
        TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Home]),
      ],
      controllers: [],
      providers: [HomesService],
    }).compile();

    homesService = moduleRef.get(HomesService);
    homeRepo = moduleRef.get(getRepositoryToken(Home));
    datasource = moduleRef.get(DataSource);
  });

  afterEach(async () =&gt {
    await homeRepo.deleteAll();
  });
})</pre>
    <p>
    The TestContainer setup begins in the <span class='inline-code'>beforeAll()</span> method, creating the postgres database. In the <span class='inline-code'>beforeEach()</span> method, 
        the database connection is initialized via Typeorm. Because we have specified the path to the migrations file, 
        and we have the migrationsrun field set to true, the migrations that are run on the primary database are also ran on the test database. 
        To connect to the test database, the container connection is used programatically</p>
            <h1>Seeding TestContainers</h1>
            <p>
                With the database set up, the next thing to do would be to seed it. There are a number of different to do so.
                One would be to seed on a per-test basis, making it extremely clear what we would want the outcome of our tests to return

<pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>
it('Fetches homes properly', async () =&gt {
      const home = new Home('Street', 'City', 'Zip', 123);
      await homeRepo.save([home]);
      const homes = await homesService.getHomes();
      expect(homes).toMatchObject([home.toJson()]);
});</pre>

                <p>
                Another way would be to have a seed script initialize the database with random data. In order to develop locally, we have developed 
                a seed script that can run on a local database to populate some example homes. We can use this also on our test container, so that
                the seeding script works both for testing and local development
                </p>

  await runSeed(datasource);

        <p>
        With these approaches, we can effectively test the communication between our application and a real database in a repeatable, maintainable manner
        </p>
            <h1>Contract Testing</h1>
            <p>
            Contract testing is an easy way to screen any basic initial problems that would occur when communicating with another application over 
            a standard such as HTTP. If another web service offers an HTTP API that your application integrates with, it makes sense that we would
            want to be able to test the interaction between the two. Integration tests that require another whole instance of the application running
            are complex, especially if the dependant application has many dependencies itslef. This is where contract testing comes in.
            Contract testing is a way to ensure that our service implements the contract of the service we are calling properly: making HTTP requests 
            with the proper path parameters, the propery types in the JSON body, etc. This can all occur without needing a full instance of an application 
            running. A service can simply generate its contract, a definintion of what it expects to recieve, distribute it to other services, and then
            those services can run tests using the contract
            </p>
            <h1>OpenAPI Specification</h1>
            <p>
            One common API contract format is the OpenAPI standard format. This is either a YAML or JSON file which describes in varying levels of detail
            what the API expects, potential response codes, and potential responses. These can be used by applications for contract testing. There 
            are many tools to generate OpenAPI specifications for existing APIs, but here is an example of the way that we are doing it in NestJS
            </p>


            <h1>Contract Generation</h1>
                <pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({transform:true}));

  const config = new DocumentBuilder()
    .setTitle('Contract Testing')
    .setDescription('Contract Testing Application')
    .setVersion('1.0')
    .addTag('homes');

  await OpenApiNestFactory.configure(app, config, {
    webServerOptions: { enabled: true, path: 'api-docs' },
    fileGeneratorOptions: { enabled: true, outputFilePath: './openapi.json' },
  });

  await app.listen(process.env.PORT ?? 3000);
}
bootstrap();
</pre>

            <p>
            With this approach, every time the application runs it generates an OpenAPI specification in JSON format with the most up to date representation of the application. Here is an example for our homes app

            <h1>HTTP Server with Prism and OpenAPI</h1>
            <p>
            In order to utilize the OpenAPI specification to it's full extent, there are services such as Prism, which can spin up HTTP servers based on 
            existing OpenAPI specifications. These servers can be as simple as serving static content that you define in your spec for each 
            response, or even generating dynamic content based on the specification provided. Prism provides a docker container which allows for

            <h1>Profiles Service</h1>
            <p>
            To show the contract testing in action, I have created another extremely basic and contrived service which makes 
            an HTTP request to the homes service, called the profiles service. The methods are extremely simple as seen below
            </p>

      param.zip,
    );
  }
}

@Injectable()

            <p>
            basic HTTP calls to the homes service fetch data, and return it along side some static data. 
            </p>

            Writing the contract tests for Profiles Service
            </h1>
            <p>
                Writing the contract tests for the profiles service is quite simple. All we need to do is spin up a mock homes API via prism, and then 
                swap the url for http requests to point to the locally hosted version of the service. Prism will handle the rest!
            </p>

            <p>
            There are a couple of <span class='inline-code'>exec</span> calls here, which can be seen in the package.json here
<pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript' style='overflow-x: auto; white-space: pre;'>
"mock:up": "curl  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jack-Gitter/contract-testing/refs/heads/main/homes/openapi.json -o homesapi.json && docker compose --profile prism up",
"mock:down": "docker compose --profile prism down"
</pre>
<span class='inline-code'>mock:up</span> fetches the Openapi spec from the homes service first, making sure that the spec is as up to date as possible. It then starts the prism
            mock server with that newly fetched file. 
            <span class='inline-code'>mock:down</span> simply tears down the mock server. With this approach,
            No mocking of the http service within NestJS is required. The tests can contain real http requests, ensuring the compatability 
            with the homes service contract. Most important of all, it occurs without having to worry about having a real 
            instance spun up, and its dependencies in order
