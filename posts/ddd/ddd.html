            <h1>Benefits and Overview of DDD</h1>
            <p class="date">April 29, 2025</p>

            <p>
                Domain Driven Design is an approach to developing software that puts a large emphasis on creating a model in code which mirrors the real 
                business as closely as possible. At the core, DDD is all about the the data model. Things such as the database design come second, and 
                are typically implemented with an ORM. There are many guidelines to follow when developing using DDD, and the process starts well before 
                any code is written. The DDD philosophy begins by introducing a Ubiquitous Language which allows for seamless communication
                between business experts and software engineers about the domain.
            </p>

            <h2>Ubiquitous Language</h2>

            <p>
                Trying to reason about code with business experts is often difficult. Code and logic typically has to be "translated" from 
                the terms used in the software to the terms business experts use, and vice versa. With translation comes loss of information, 
                and loss of information causes errors in implementation. A Ubiquitous Language eliminates these concerns by defining a set of terms 
                used to describe the business so domain experts and developers can communicate flawlessly. Typically, terms from the business are utilized 
                and integrated into the Ubiquitous Language when possible, to have the model remain as accurate as possible. </p>

            <h2>Value Objects</h2>
            <p>
                In DDD, the smallest unit of building block is typically a Value Object. Value Objects are pieces of a model which obtain value soley 
                on the content of their components. To put it more concretely, a JSON Value Object which has the same exact fields as another JSON 
                Value Object are equal. They are typically created as immutable, as changing one value of the value object would completly change the object. 
                In the circumstance where a Value Object is expected to change, it is preffered to create an entire new object. A good example of a 
                Value Object is a name.

                <pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'> export type Name = { first: string; middle?: string; last: string; } </pre>

                A name might include first, middle, and last components. Changing any part of this name completly makes it a new name entirely. 
                </p>


            <h2>Entities</h2>

            <p>
                Entities are the next largest buliding blocks of DDD. They are the code representation of business objects, concepts, and logic. They always
                have a unique ID, typically implemented as a simple UUID. This represents their intrinsic real life value when compared to
                the value objects that compose them.

                <div class='sidenote'>
                    There is often confusion between Entities and Value Objects when first learning DDD. The difference is best explained via an example.
                    Lets take the example of a Person Entity which has a name Value Object field. A person can change their name (swap it out for another
                    Value Object), but the person themselves is still intrinsically the same person they previously were. 
                </div>

                Most of the time, Entities are implemented as classes in an OOP language. Mostly all business logic should reside as methods within an Entity.
                Entities should have no external dependencies outside of the domain layer, only focused on implementing business logic as accurately as 
                possible.

                <div class='sidenote'>
                    There exists a notion betwen "thick" and "thin" domain models. A thick model is when business logic is implemented on 
                    an Entity as methods, whereas a thin model's business logic is implemented in services which wrap Entities. DDD heavily 
                    favors thick domain models, as the logic is isolated, reusable, and can tested without any dependencies. When developing a thin model,
                    logic is not reusable between services, and is much harder to test. Services frequently have dependencies on repositories, 
                    and this causes the need to mock datbase connections simply to test domain logic.
                </div>

                Here is an Entity implementation in code
                <pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>export class Reservation {

    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
    public id: UUID

    @ManyToOne(() => Flight, (flight) => flight.reservations, {orphanedRowAction: 'delete'})
    public flight: UUID

    @Column(() => SeatPosition)
    public seatPosition: SeatPosition

    @Column('uuid')
    public personId: UUID

    private constructor(seatPosition: SeatPosition, personId: UUID, flight: UUID) {
        this.seatPosition = seatPosition
        this.personId = personId
        this.flight = flight
    }

    static CreateReservation(seatPosition: SeatPosition, personId: UUID, flight: UUID): Reservation {
        return new Reservation(seatPosition, personId, flight)
    }
}

</pre>

            This Entity represents reservation for a flight. It is comprised of a Value Object called <span class='inline-code'>SeatPosition</span> 
            which contains seat position information, 
            and also has foreign references to both the person Entity (via <span class='inline-code'>personId</span> UUID) who made the reservation, 
            and the flight Entity (via <span class='inline-code'>flight</span> UUID) to which the reservation 
            is associated with. Given a more complete understanding of Entities and Value Objects, another viewpoint of the relationship 
            between the two can be realized: Value Objects, such as <span class='inline-code'>SeatPosition</span>, 
            make up a subset of the columns in a database entry. 
            The entire record is the Entity itself. If a <span class='inline-code'>Reservation</span> gets upgraded to first class, 
            the <span class='inline-code'>SeatPosition</span> would change, but the <span class='inline-code'>Reservation</span>
            still holds the same intrinsic value it previously did. Thinking database-first is against the DDD methodology, 
            but this analogy helps drive home the differences between these two fundamental building blocks.
            </p>

            <h2>Aggregate Roots</h2>
            <p>
                An Aggregate is a collection of Entities that typically belongs together in a database transaction. An Aggregate Root is the Entity which
                controls other Entities in any given Aggregate. An Agggregate Root represents a consisstency boundary. If two or more entities
                cannot be out of sync for any period of time, they must be organized together in an Aggregate. Because of this, all work done to an 
                Aggregate must be done via the interface for the Aggregate Root, so that it can ensure business invariants are satisfied. 
                An Aggregate Root can be thought of as an orchestrator for the sub-Entities that it contains. It 
                has a complete view of all its objects, so it can ensure that no invariants are ever violated when performing business logic.

<pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>export class Flight {

    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
    public id: UUID

    @Column({type: 'enum', enum: FLIGHT_STATUS, default: FLIGHT_STATUS.ON_TIME})

        }

        const seat = this.seats.find((seat) => seat.position.equals(seatPosition))

        if (!seat) {
            throw new BadRequestException(
            `No seat found with the position ${seatPosition} on the flight ${this.id}`

            )
        }

        this.reservations.push(reservation)
    }

    public cancelReservation(seatPosition: SeatPosition, personId: UUID) {

        if (!this.reservations) {

        }

        if (!existingReservation) {
            throw new BadRequestException(
            `No existing reservation with that information exists`
            )
        }

        this.reservations = this.reservations.filter((reservation) => 
            { reservation.id !== existingReservation.id })

    }

    public cancelReservationsByPerson(personId: UUID) {

        if (!this.reservations) {
            throw new BadRequestException(`No reservations exist for this flight!`)
        }

        const existingReservations = this.reservations.filter((reservation) => 
            reservation.personId === personId)

        if (existingReservations.length === 0) {
            throw new BadRequestException(
            `No existing reservation with that information exists`
            )
        }

        this.reservations = this.reservations.filter((reservation) => 
            reservation.personId !== personId)

    }

    public setSchedule(schedule: UUID) {
        this.schedule = schedule
    }

    public removeSchedule() {
        this.schedule = null
    }
} </pre> 

            The above example represents the Aggregate Root for a flight in flight reservation software. The business requirements state that at no time 
            must a single seat ever be booked by more than one person. With this, we know that the all the seats and reservations for a singular flight 
            must be encapsulated within the Flight Aggregate. This gives the Flight Aggregate Root the ability to know the state of all 
            seats and reservations, and enforce the the required invariant. The implementation can be seen in the 
            <span class='inline-code'>MakeReservation</span> method, where logic ensures that no other reservation exists for the given flight 
            before allowing a user to book a seat.
            </p>

            <p>
            Taking a closer look at the <span class='inline-code'>Flight</span> Aggregate, we can see that there is not only encapsulation, 
            but also another form of a relationship: a reference. The <span class='inline-code'>Flight</span> Aggregate Root has a reference to the 
            schedule that is associated with the current flight. For our business, there are no totalities enforced on the 
            relationship between a schedule and a flight. Due to this, the flight schedule does not need to be encapsulated in the 
            <span class='inline-code'>Flight</span> Aggregate but rather can be its own Entity. 
            Communication between the two can occur via domain events, reaching an eventually consistent state. 
            At a later point if needed, this object can be easily refactored into a separate service since no database transactions 
            need to contain both the <span class='inline-code'>Flight</span> and the corresponding schedule.
            </p>

            <h2>Factory Pattern</h2>

            <p>
            The factory pattern is heavily used in DDD to construct complex Aggregates, and enforce invariants while doing so. In the case of a 
            <span class='inline-code'>Flight</span>, there might be some requirements that exist for a flight to be created. 
            Some of these could include commercial flights containing a higher quantity of cheap seats, when compared to the private counterpart. 
            Extracting this functionality from the <span class='inline-code'>Flight</span> Aggregate itself keeps the 
            Aggregate and <span class='inline-code'>FlightFactory</span> classes cleaner, and helps to enforce the single responsibility principal. 
            Additionally testing the creation of the Aggregate can now be separated from the implementation.

<pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>export class FlightFactory {
    public createFlight(flightType: FLIGHT_TYPE): Flight {
        let seats: Array<Seat>
        const flightId = randomUUID()
        switch (flightType) {
            case FLIGHT_TYPE.Commercial: 
                seats = this.generateSeats(
                    flightId, flightType, new Price(
                        USD, 
                        BASE_COMMERCIAL_FLIGHT_PRICE_UNITS, 
                        BASE_COMMERCIAL_FLIGHT_PRICE_SUB_UNITS)
                    )
                return new Flight(flightId, seats)
            case FLIGHT_TYPE.Private:
                seats = this.generateSeats(
                    flightId, 
                    flightType, 
                    new Price(
                        USD, 
                        BASE_PRIVATE_FLIGHT_SUB_UNITS, 
                        BASE_PRIVATE_FLIGHT_SUB_UNITS)
                    )
                return new Flight(flightId, seats)
            default: 
                throw new BadRequestException('Unknown Flight Type')
        }
    }

    private generateSeats(flightId: UUID, flightType: FLIGHT_TYPE, basePrice: Price): Array<Seat> {
        switch (flightType) {
            case FLIGHT_TYPE.Commercial: 
                return this.seatAlgorithm(flightId, COMMERCIAL_FLIGHT_ROW_COUNT, basePrice)
            case FLIGHT_TYPE.Private:
                return this.seatAlgorithm(flightId, PRIVATE_FLIGHT_ROW_COUNT, basePrice)
            default: 
                throw new BadRequestException('Unknown Flight Type')
        }
    }

    private seatAlgorithm(flightId: UUID, flightRowCount: number, basePrice: Price): Array<Seat> {
        const flightSeats: Array<Seat> = new Array<Seat>()
        for (const seatRow of [...Array(flightRowCount).keys()]) {
            for (const seatCol of Object.values(SEAT_COLUMN)) {
                const seatPosition = new SeatPosition(seatRow, seatCol)
                const newUnits = 
                    basePrice.getUnitsCopy() + Math.floor(Math.random() * SEAT_VOLITILITY)
                const seatPrice = 
                    new Price(basePrice.getCurrencyCopy(), newUnits, basePrice.getSubUnitsCopy())
                const seat = 
                    Seat.CreateSeat(flightId, seatPosition, seatPrice)
                flightSeats.push(seat)
            }
        }
        return flightSeats
    }
}
</pre>
            Here, the complex logic of generating seats depending on what type of flight is created is localized only to this class itself. 
            It does not clutter the <span class='inline-code'>Flight</span> Entity itself, nor is it relevant to <span class='inline-code'>Flight</span> 
            functionality. 
            </p>


            <h2>Repository Pattern</h2>

            <p>
                Repositories are classes created in the infrastructure layer responsible with interfacing with the underlying data storage solution
                to fetch Aggregate Roots. There should be one Repository per Aggregate Root, and Repositories should only ever load Aggregate Roots 
                into memory. This is because the Aggregate Root enforces the invariants amongst sub-Entities, and fetching a sub-Entity directly 
                would allow for bypassing the invariant checks that would have otherwise been performed by the Aggregate Root. 
                Many ORMs implement the Repository pattern, so that developers can take a code-first approach. Typical Repository usage is to load an 
                Aggregate Root from the datbase, perform business operations, and then use the Repository to save the Entity back to the database. 

<pre class='prettyprint lang-typescript'>export class AddSegmentService {

    constructor(
        @InjectRepository(FlightSchedule) private flightScheduleRepository: Repository<FlightSchedule>
    ) {}

    public async addSegment(
        scheduleId: UUID, 
        toName: string, 
        toLongitude: number, 
        toLatitude: number, 
        fromName: string, 
        fromLongitude: number, 
        fromLatitude: number, 
        start: Date, 
        end: Date
    ) {
        await this.flightScheduleRepository.manager.transaction(async (EntityManager) => {
            const to = new Location(toName, toLongitude, toLatitude)
            const from = new Location(fromName, fromLongitude, fromLatitude)
            const segment = new Segment(to, from, start, end)
            const flightScheduleRepository = EntityManager.getRepository(FlightSchedule)
            
            const flightSchedule = await flightScheduleRepository.findOne({
                relations: ['segments'],
                where: {id: scheduleId}
            })

            if (!flightSchedule) {
                throw new BadRequestException(`No schedule with id ${scheduleId}`)
            }

            flightSchedule.addSegment(segment)

            return await this.flightScheduleRepository.save(flightSchedule)
        })
    }

}
                </pre>

                In the above example, we can see the process involved in adding a new <span class='inline-code'>Segment</span> to a 
                <span class='inline-code'>FlightSchedule</span> using a Repository. 

                <div class='sidenote'>
                    When performing in-memory manipulation of an object and then saving it back to the database, there must be some 
                    method in place to avoid data races. Data races can be caused by other threads or instances of the application loading the 
                    same Aggregate as another thread or instance, performing a conflicting operation, 
                    and then saving it back to the database at the same time. The two most prominant ways to prevent a data race are to either use 
                    pessimistic or optimistic locking at the database level. Both implementations prevent the described undesired behavior, 
                    although pessimistic locking is better for applications which are expected to have more conflicts, and optimistic locking is better 
                    for instances where the application is not expected to have frequent concurrency issues.
                </div>
            </p>



            <h2>Domain Services</h2>
            <p>
                Domain services are used to implement domain logic between two Entities when said logic does not fit well into a single
                Entity. Typically, Domain Services should not depend on anything outside of the domain layer. They are passed in
                one or more Aggregate Roots, and implement pure business logic. A concrete example of a domain in which a Domain Service should be used is
                a social media platform. On this platform, users can follow eachother. It would not make sense to have the business logic for this feature
                implemented on a single user object, since it spans multiple users at once. Rather, it would make the most sense to load both users 
                into memory, pass them to a Domain Service, and allow the domain service to call methods such as 
                <span class='inline-code'>updateFollowers()</span> and <span class='inline-code'>updateFollowing()</span> on the respective Entities.
            </p>


            <h2>Application Services</h2>

            <p>
                Application services are the orchestrators of different business functionality. They are responsible for loading Aggregate Roots from the 
                database by using Repositories, making the calls to business logic through those Aggregates, saving Entities back to the database, 
                and making any other external calls the business logic needs. The following is an example of an Application Service which 
                implements logic to create a reservation on a particular flight.

            <h2>Domain events</h2>

            <p>
                Domain events are used to communicate between Aggregate Roots. Because two Aggregate Roots do not need to be immediately consistent, 
                they can be decoupled and communicate via a message broker or other asynchronous means to achieve a common goal.
                Using this model allows for refactoring Aggregate Roots into separate microservice, since an eventually consistent model is already 
                implemented.
            </p>


            <h2>Bounded Contexts and Microservices</h2>
            <p>
                Different sections of business functionality are typically represented by different Bounded Contexts. In the case of a 
                flight reservation application, there might be one Bounded Context which handles all the information surrounding booking flights, 
                and another Bounded Context which is responsible for keeping track of user accounts and related information. 
                Each Bounded Context in a microservice architecture is represented by a new microservice. 
                Information in one Bounded Context's data model should be only relevant to the context of that bounded context. 
                In the Bounded Context which handles flight reservations, a flight is composed of seats, reservations, segments, etc. 
                The reservation context needs all of this information to reason about the availability of flights and validity of attempted reservations. 
                In the user acounts Bounded Context, a flight is simply a UUID, pointing to an Entity in the reservation context.
                The user context might only care about how many flights a user has taken so it can set the user's status to "Premium" if they have flown over 
                1000 times. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to the separation of conerns, messages between Bounded Contexts can be thin, meaning that they contain little information.
                This is because information is not duplicated accross microservies, so instead of sending data from one application to another, 
                event-style messages are sent to kick off a process. This generallly contains the UUID of a specific Entity in the calling Bounded Context. 
            </p>

            <h2>CQRS</h2>

            <p>
                CQRS, or Command Query Response Separation, is a methodology often paired with DDD. Since SELECT queries do not effect the database
                in any way, there are no invariants or business logic to uphold. The model for updating records and fetching data 
                then often naturally different. With CQRS, Aggregates are used to inforce business rules and update or create Entities, and separate 
                models which are totally unrelated to the Aggregates can be created to load and display information to users. 
                Utilizing Aggregates to load and return data is not only overly complex, but also will likely negatively impact the accuracy of the model in ways which are unnecssary.
            </p>
