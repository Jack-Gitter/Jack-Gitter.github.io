            <p>
                Domain Driven Design is an approach to software design that puts a very heavy emphasis on the domain and business model. At its core, 
                DDD puts an extreme focus on accurately map the business domain into code. Its mainly concerned with the data model, and things such as 
                the database design come second. There are many guidelines to follow when developing an application in a DDD style, but before 
                jumping into code, something that is extremely important in the DDD philosophy is utilizing a ubiquitous language to communicate
                with business experts to get a better understanding about business operations, and easily communicate what the code is doing.
            </p>

            <h2>Ubiquitous language</h2>

            <p>
                When discussing existing code logic and business requirements with business experts, communication typically has to be "translated" from 
                what the terms business experts use, and what is used in the code. With translation comes loss of information, and loss of information 
                causes errors in business logic implementation, purley by misunderstanding. Ubiquitous language attempts to eliminate this translation
                by defining a set of terms used to describe business related terms so everyone can communicate on a even playing field. Typically, these
                terms are grabbed from the business when possible, as to have the code model implementation stay as close to the real life business as possible.
            </p>

            <h2>Entities</h2>

            <p>
                entities are the buliding blocks of DDD, They are the code representation of business objects, concepts, and logic. Most of the time,
                they are implemented as classes in an OOP language. Business logic should be contained 



                ease of testing. entities do not deped on anything else, making business logic extremely easy to test. no mocking database connections, etc
            </p>


            <h2>Aggregate Roots</h2>


            <h2>Domain Services</h2>
            <p>
                is used only to implement logic between two entities, when the business logic does not naturally fit into any entity itself

                example is two users following each other, you have a followUserService
            </p>


            <h2>Application Services</h2>

            <p>
            interacts with things outside of entities, like coordinating database, etc. It is just a coordinator of an entire feature
            </p>


            <h2>Repository Pattern</h2>

            <h2>Bounded Contexts and Microservices</h2>
