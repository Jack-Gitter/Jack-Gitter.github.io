            <h1>How to Propegate Transactions Across Repositories</h1>
            <p class="date">May 7, 2025</p>
            <p>
                Often times when handling requests within a backend application, multiple database queries need to occur in order to 
                acomplish some business functionality. Dealing with multiple queries to the database often means that a transaction is 
                required in order to ensure data consistency. Assuming a basic three layer architecture, an application typically has
                some form of repositories or DAO living in the infrastructure layer which is used to interface with databases. 
                When utilizing multiple repositories within a single request, one database connection which starts a
                transaction must be shared between multiple separate repositories. There are multiple methods to achieve this, but depending on how 
                the underlying data is structured, it might not be necessary at all. 
            </p>

            <h2>DDD</h2>
            <p>
                With a smart domain model emphasized by <a href="https://Jack-Gitter.github.io/posts/ddd/ddd.html">DDD</a>
                transactions which span repositories is actually a code smell. Repositories fetch aggregate roots, which contains enough
                information to make decisions about business functionality which must be transactionally consistent. With this approach, 
                if transactions must span mutliple repositories the domain model must be reconsidered.
            </p>

            <h2>Repository Functions Accepting DB Connections</h2>
            <p>
                The most naive approach to managing consistency across repositories is have each repository method accept an optional 
                database connection. If one is provided, the method will utilize it to query to the database, and otherwise it can grab a connection
                from a database pool to make an isolated request. The following example comes from a golang distributed backend system 
                for a website that mimics the functionality of letterboxd, but for music.

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-go">func(p *PostsDAO) LikePost(executor db.QueryExecutor, 
                           spotifyID string, 
                           posterSpotifyID string, 
                           songID string) error {
    query := 
        `INSERT INTO post_votes 
            (voterspotifyid, posterspotifyid, postsongid, createdat, updatedat, liked) 
        VALUES 
            ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6) 
        ON CONFLICT 
            (voterspotifyid, posterspotifyid, postsongid) 
        DO UPDATE SET 
            updatedat=$5, liked=$6`

    res, err := executor.Exec(query,
        spotifyID,
        posterSpotifyID,
        songID,
        time.Now().UTC(),
        time.Now().UTC(),
        true)

    if err != nil {
        return customerrors.WrapBasicError(err)
    }

    rows, err := res.RowsAffected()

    if err != nil {
        return customerrors.WrapBasicError(err)
    }

    if rows < 1 {
        return customerrors.WrapBasicError(sql.ErrNoRows)
    }

    return nil

}
</pre>
                
                The first argument to the function is a <span class='inline-code'>db.QueryExectutor</span>, an interface that wraps
                a database connection so that the underlying database connection can be replaced with minimal changes.
                This implementation works, although it creates unnecssary complexity within the application layer. Services 
                must manage the database connection which causes an abstraction leak between the application layer and infrastructure layer.
            </p>


            <h2>Context/Async/Thread Local Storage and Interceptors</h2>
            <p>
                A more sophisticated solution of sharing a database connection amongst repositories involves utilizing thread local storage. 
                Also known as Async and Context local storage, thread local storage helps to store information isolated to a single execution thread.
                This makes it possible to initilize a transaction and expose the database connection via thread local storage, and for each 
                repository check if there is an avaialble connection in the thread local storage. If one exists, it will be used to execute 
                any given query. If not, the repository can grab a connection from the pool. In order to create the initial database connection 
                and start the transaction, it must be known whether or not a service method requires a transaction. 
            </p>

                <p>
                Interceptors allow for code execution before service methods. Most backend frameworks have some form of interceptors, 
                although for this example I'll be using NestJS. Interceptors are implemented as decorators, and can help to grab a database connection
                from a pool, begin a transaction, and store the connection into context local storage. The connection can then be accessed by the 
                repositories used in the method itself. The Interceptor manages the entire lifecyle of the transaction, starting the transaction and 
                observing the http response. If an error is detected, it will rollback the transaction.
                </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-typescript">export class TransactionInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  constructor(
    private dataSource: DataSource,
    private cls: ClsService,
  ) {}

  async intercept(
    context: ExecutionContext,
    next: CallHandler,
  ): Promise<Observable<any>> {
    const queryRunner = this.dataSource.createQueryRunner();
    queryRunner.connect();
    queryRunner.startTransaction();
    const manager = queryRunner.manager;
    this.cls.set('connection', manager);
    return next.handle().pipe(
      concatMap(async (data) => {
        await queryRunner.commitTransaction();
        return data;
      }),
      catchError(async (error) => {
        await queryRunner.rollbackTransaction();
        throw error;
      }),
      finalize(async () => {
        await queryRunner.release();
      }),
    );

  constructor(

  ) {
    this.queryRunner = cls.get('connection') ?? dataSource.manager;
  }

  // return the id of the item if in stock
  async getStock(itemName: string): Promise<number> {
    this.queryRunner = this.cls.get('connection') ?? this.dataSource.manager;
    const res = await this.queryRunner.query<Inventory>(
      `SELECT count(*) FROM inventory WHERE "itemName" = $1`,
      [itemName],
    );
    return res[0].count;
  }
  </pre>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-typescript">export class OrdersService {
  constructor(
    private paymentService: PaymentService,
    private inventoryService: InventoryService,
    private invoiceService: InvoiceService,
  ) {}

  @UseInterceptors(TransactionInterceptor)
  async placeOrder(itemName: string, user: string, price: number) {
    await this.inventoryService.checkAndReduceStock(itemName);
    await this.paymentService.checkAndChargePayment(user, price);
    await this.invoiceService.provideInvoice(user, price);
  }
}
</pre>


<pre class="prettyprint lang-typescript">
@Injectable()
export class InventoryService {
  constructor(private inventoryDAO: InventoryDAO) {}
  async checkAndReduceStock(itemName: string) {
    const stock = await this.inventoryDAO.getStock(itemName);
    if (stock <= 0) {
      throw new NotFoundException(
        'unable to process request. Not enough inventory',
      );
    }
    this.inventoryDAO.reduceStock(itemName);
  }
}
</pre>

  <p>
  The individual services utilize repositories in order to interact with the database, and those repositories will utilize the shared connection
  created by the interceptor. With frameworks that implement decorators such as Springboot's <span class='inline-code'>@Transactional()</span>, 
  this is typically how it is implemented. However I wanted a more foundational understanding of how this could be achieved, 
  and discovered the Unit of Work Pattern.
  </p>


            <h2>Unit of Work Pattern</h2>

            <p>
            The Unit of Work pattern is a way to abstract all functionality that occurs within the database across the lifetime of a request. 
            It allows an application to make changes across multiple different repositories commit them all at once. At its core, the Unit of Work 
            pattern manages request scoped instance of repositories. Upon a new request, it starts a database transaction and provides the 
            request scoped repositories with an instance of the database connection. Methods exist on the Unit of Work class to fetch these 
            repositories. There are also typically methods to commit and rollback the overarching transaction shared between repositories. 
            This implementation has many benefits. The Unit of Work is injected into services so it can be mocked for testing, it eliminates the leaky 
            abstraction by encapsulating the database connection, hiding it away from the application service. It can also be implemented 
            in a slightly different manner, returning the connection to the user and having them manually begin, commit, and rollback connections. This does
            leak the abstraction, but it was the implementation that I went with as I was inspired by 
    <a href='https://orkhan.gitbook.io/typeorm/docs/transactions#using-queryrunner-to-create-and-control-state-of-single-database-connection'>Typeorm.</a>
            The Unit of Work class is implemented below as the <span class='inline-code'>TransactionManager</span>
            </p>


<pre class="prettyprint lang-typescript">
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Pool, PoolClient } from 'pg';
import { DAO } from '../types';

Injectable();
export class TransactionManager {
  constructor(private pool: Pool) {}

  /* the end user must call repository.close() when done with use 
  on transaction, that way the connection is closed! */
  async getDAOsForTransaction(
    ...constructors: DAO<any>[]
  ): Promise<[any[], PoolClient]> {
    const connection = await this.pool.connect();
    return [
      constructors.map((constructor) => new constructor(connection)),
      connection,
    ];
  }
}
            </pre>

            Given the names of repositories, the <span class='inline-code'>TransactionManager</span> instantiates the list of repositories with the 
            individual connection taken from the pool. It returns the repositories and the connection to the user.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-typescript">@Injectable()
export class OrdersService {
  constructor(
    private paymentService: PaymentService,
    private inventoryService: InventoryService,
    private invoiceService: InvoiceService,
    private transactionManager: TransactionManager,
  ) {}
  async placeOrder(itemName: string, user: string) {
    const price = await this.inventoryService.getPrice(itemName);
    await this.paymentService.checkAndChargePayment(user, price);
    await this.inventoryService.checkAndReduceStock(itemName);
    await this.invoiceService.provideInvoice(user, price);
  }
  async placeOrderTransaction(itemName: string, user: string) {
    const [daosForTransaction, connection] =
      await this.transactionManager.getDAOsForTransaction(
        InventoryDAO,
        InvoiceDAO,
        AccountBalanceDAO,
      );

    const inventoryService = new InventoryService(daosForTransaction[0]);
    const invoiceService = new InvoiceService(daosForTransaction[1]);
    const paymentService = new PaymentService(daosForTransaction[2]);

    connection.query('BEGIN TRANSACTION');

    try {
      const price = await this.inventoryService.getPrice(itemName);
      await paymentService.checkAndChargePayment(user, price);
      await inventoryService.checkAndReduceStock(itemName);
      await invoiceService.provideInvoice(user, price);
    } catch (e: unknown) {
      connection.query('ROLLBACK');
      throw e;
    } finally {
      connection.release();
    }
  }
}

            </pre>

            The <span class='inline-code'>OrdersService</span>injects the <span class='inline-code'>TransactionManager</span>, fetches repositories 
            from it, and then starts a transaction. It executes multiple repository functions all which utilize the same transaction, 
            and then performs a commit or rollback accordingly. It also releases the connection back to the pool.

            Two example repos were used in this article. The first is a <a href="https://github.com/Jack-Gitter/tunes">Golang repository</a>
            which is a distributed backend service. The second is an isolated
