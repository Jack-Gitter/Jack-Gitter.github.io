			<h2>What is SSO</h2>
				Single sign on, otherwise known as SSO, is a technique that allows an end user to sign in once, and access an entire suite of applications without having to authenticate into each individual service. Before understanding the intricacies of SSO, there are a couple of useful terms to understand

                <dl>
                  <dt>Identity Provider</dt>
                  <dd>The identity provider is the "service" that handles authentication for end users. It keeps track of user logins, and verifies that users are who they say they are. Common examples of an IDP are Okta, and Auth0</dd>

                  <dt>Service Provider</dt>
                  <dd>
					  The Service Provider, or SP, is the service that the end user actually wants to gain access to after authenticating. Depending on the end user, they might have access to a variety of different services, such as gitlab, or a CRM. After authenticating via an IDP, the users are able to access the SP without requiring another round of authentcation
				  </dd>
                </dl>

			<h2>IDP Initiated SSO</h2>
			<p>
			IDP initiated SSO is one of the two possible SSO flows involved with SAML, which is something we will discuss later. IDP initiated SSO involves first signing into an identity provider, like okta, and then being able to click into individual service providers. 


            <div class="image-description-block">
			<img src="./okta-experience.png" style="width:100%">
                <p>
				Example login screen after authenticating via Okta
                </p>
            </div>

			As you can see, all of the available clickable boxes represents a service provider that the user has access to
			</p>
			<h3>Very high-level example</h3>
				IDP initiated SSO flow goes like this

				<ol>
					<li>
						User navigates to their IDP, for example www.okta.com
					</li>
					<li>
						User enters authentication information and signs-in, and the IDP creates a session for the user
					</li>
					<li>
						The IDP gathers information on the logged-in user, and 
						creates a bundle of information to send to the service provider
					</li>
					<li>
						When the user clicks the cards for a service provider, the user information 
						is sent to the service provider. The service providers validate the information is 
						from Okta, and then create a user session and allow the user in based on the information
						that okta has provided in the SAML Response
					</li>
				</ol>

			<h2>SP Initiated SSO</h2>
				The other flow option for SSO is SP-initiated SSO. This flow goes like so

				<h3>Very high-level example</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						User navigates to their SP of choice, for example www.linkedin.com
					</li>
					<li>
						the service provider sends an authentication request to the IDP with information about who the service provider is, what time the request occured, etc.
					</li>
					<li>
						The IDP will parse this response, and then redirect the user to their login screen
					</li>
					<li>
						The user signs in with their IDP, and the IDP once again creates the bundle of user information
					</li>
					<li>
						This time, the user is automatically redirected to the service provider,  
					</li>
					<li>
						The service provider verifies in the information is from the IDP, and then cretes the user session
					</li>
				</ol>

			<h2>What is XML</h2>
			XML, also known as extensible markup language, 
			is the format in which messages are sent between the IDP and the SP. It is important for them to establish a "language" to 
			communicate with, so that they can parse and understand messages easily
			<h2>What is SAML</h2>
			SAML is a security assertion markup language, which utilizes XML. It is an open standard, essentially a defined schema in which to write XML that both the service providers and identity providers expect. 
			<h3>SAML Request</h3>
			The SAML request is what is sent from the sp to the idp during service provider initiated SSO. The service provider essentially is requesting the user be authenticated via the IDP.
			An example of a SAML request looks like so:

			<img src="blah">

                <dl>
                  <dt>AuthnRequest</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                  <dt>Issuer</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                </dl>


			<h3>SAML Response</h3>
			The SAML response is used in both the IDP initiated and sp initiated sso flows. This is the bundle of user information that is sent from the idp to the service provider, to explain that the user has authenticated properly and apss any relevaant user information to the SP. There are many more important fields in this, so we will take a deeper look
			<img src="blah">

                <dl>
                  <dt>Response</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                  <dt>Status</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                  <dt>Assertion</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                  <dt>Issuer</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                  <dt>Conditions</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                  <dt>Audience</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                  <dt>Signing Information</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                  <dt>Subject</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                  <dt>NameID</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                  <dt>Attributes</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                  <dt>AuthnStatement</dt>
                  <dd></dd>
                </dl>

			<h2>IAmShowcase website</h2>
			For all the code examples, the code will be acting as the identity provider in the flow. As such, we need a service provider in the loop. A great website for this is <a href="https://sptest.iamshowcase.com">IAmShowcase</a> which acts as a mock service provider and supports both idp initiated and service provider initiated SSO.
