            <h1>How To Achieve Bulletproof Microservice Communication</h1>
            <p class="date">April 24, 2025</p>

            <p>
                Utilizing microserves in order to decouple a backend system into individually scalable and customizable applications is
                an effective method to build sustainable infrastructure. Pair this with dockerized services and an orchestration platform such as
                Kubernetes, and the infrastruture is robust
            </p>
            <p>
                With all these benefits, why would anyone ever decide to go in another direction? One of the biggest challenges when developing microservices
                is data integrity and consistency. Microsverices that utilize simple HTTP requests and isolated database transactions are bound to end up in
                an inconsistent state sooner or later, and I want to discuss how to avoid it.
            </p>

            <h2>The Setup</h2>

            <p>
                Consider an ecommerce business where you can place orders for various different items, and have them shipped to you around the world.
                This business might have services for keeping track of orders, managing inventory, and validating shipping requirements. These can be called
                the <span class="inline-service">Orders</span>, <span class="inline-service">Inventory</span>, and <span class="inline-service">Shipping</span> 
                microservices, respectively. When a user places an order, an <span class="inline-code">Order</span> Entity is entered into the 
                database as a record in a pending state. Afterwards a message is sent to the <span class="inline-service">Inventory</span> service to 
                check whether there is enough inventory of the particular product. The <span class= "inline-service">Inventory</span> service then 
                creates a <span class="inline-code">Reservation</span> Entity, and stores it in the database to keep track of the current status of the warehouse,
                after which it notifies the <span class="inline-service">Orders</span> of its success. Then, the <span class="inline-service">Orders</span> service 
                must reach out to the <span class="inline-service">Shipping</span> service to validate that the customer is within the allowed shipping range 
                for the specific product. Only after which, can the <span class="inline-service">Orders</span> service then notify the 
                <span class="inline-service">Inventory</span> application delete the <span class="inline-code">Reservation</span> Entity and corresponding 
                inventory, and set the <span class="inline-code">Order</span> Entity status to approved. All of these steps together form a Saga, 
                a long running, evetually consistent business process. 
            </p>

            <h2>Queues</h2>

            <p>
                There are many different ways that different computers can communicate with one another. One of the most popular is the HTTP protocol With HTTP, 
                failed requests due to networking or service outages are hard to overcome. 
                <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff'>Exponential Backoff</a> can be used to improve upon standard usage,
                although it achieves little of what could be done by a message broker. A message broker
                typically utilizes queues in order to route requests between services. Some of the biggest improvements seen when switching over to 
                using message queues for communication is decoupling of applications and increased durability. 
                A message queue can be thought of like a buffer. It holds messages until the reciever is ready. In the event of a message consumption failure,
                it can also re-queue messages. Below is a comparison between inter-service communication between two services, 
                the <span class="inline-service"> Orders</span> service and <span class="inline-service">Inventory</span> service. 
                <span class="inline-service">Orders</span> is attempting to send a message to <span class='inline-service'>Inventory</span>, 
                although <span class='inline-service'>Inventory</span> is currently unavailable.
            </p>

                        <div class="note">Message delivered when Service B comes back online</div>
                    </div>

                <div class='sidenote'>
                    As a side note, messages between services should be "thin", meaning they should not contain a lot of data. One
                    of the huge benefits of microserices is that the <span class='inline-service'>Orders</span> service should know a lot about order details, 
                    but the <span class='inline-service'>Inventory</span> service might only need to know the product ID associated with the order. 
                    This results in a nice separation of concerns, leading to messages which only need to hold foreign references to entities 
                    owned by other services. 
                </div>

                With queues inbetween services, the resiliance of the entire process has been greatly improved, but it is not perfect. Consider the following 
                scenario. The <span class='inline-service'>Orders</span> service recieves a message to place a pending order. 
                It writes an <span class='inline-code'>Order</span> to the database, but crashes before it can send an inventory reservation message to the queue. 
                The order service will come back online, and have a pending <span class='inline-code'>Orders</span> in the database, but no message sent out to 
                kick off the Saga.
            </p>

            <h2>Outbox Pattern</h2>

            <p>
                An outbox is a holding station for any outgoing messages that a service needs to eventually send. This is best implemented as a database table, 
                so that sending a message and performing necessary business logic can all occur atomically. To get an idea of how this is structured, we can 
                use the <span class='inline-service'>Orders</span> and <span class='inline-service'>Inventory</span> services one again. To kick off the process,
                an HTTP request is routed to the <span class='inline-service'>Orders</span> service to place an order. The service starts a database transaction, 
                writes the <span class='inline-code'>Order</span> Entity to the database, and then writes a message to the 
                <span class='inline-code'>InventoryReservationOutbox</span> table. The service then commits the transaction, so that both the message and 
                the Entity are both written, or neither are. On startup, the <span class='inline-service'>Orders</span> service polls the 
                <span class='inline-code'>InventoryReservationOutbox</span> table for outgoing messages every couple of seconds. Once this polling callback is 
                triggered, all messagea are queries from the outbox table, converted into JSON, and sent into the queue for the 
                <span class='inline-service'>Inventory</span> service to process at a later point. Once the message is in the queue, it is safe to 
                be deleted from the <span class='inline-code'>InventoryReservationOutbox</span> table. Most queues have configurable 
                durability, meaning if they crash with messages inside them they are able to enqueue them after coming back up again. 

                Next, we have to take a look at something known as "at least once" delivery. This is typical of message brokers, meaning messages might be 
                sent to consumers more than once. 
            </p>
            

            <h2>Inbox Pattern</h2>
            <p>
                The inbox pattern, better known as the idempotent consumer pattern, utilizes a nearly identical approach to the the outbox pattern, just in reverse.
                When using this pattern, incomming messages are written into a database table within a transaction which handles the work associated to the 
                message itself. If the work (for example, creating an Entity and inserting into the database) succeeds, 
                then the message is written to the inbox table. If the work fails, then we can reprocess the message at a later point.
                When a new message comes in, the inbox table is first checked to determine if an identical message
                has already been processed to avoid duplicated work. To detect duplicate messages, a unique key must be assigned to each new message. 
                To give a concrete example, the <span class='inline-service'>Orders</span> service includes the specific, auto incrementing 
                primary key for each specific <span class='inline-code'>Order</span> Entity to the message it sends to the 
                <span class='inline-service'>Inventory</span> Service. With this identifier, the <span class='inline-service'>Inventory</span> service 
                is able to detect duplicated messages. It recieves the message, begins a transaction, 
                reserves inventory, writes the incomming message to the outbox, and a response message to the InventoryReservation outbox table, to later be sent
                to the Order service to continue on with the Saga

                <div class='sidenote'>
                    It is important to know that without this unique ID associated with each <span class='inline-code'>Order</span> Entity attached to the message,
                    its impossible to differentiate two messages with the same contents. For example, if two customers place orders for the same product and quantity,
                    the <span class='inline-service'>Inventory</span> service would have no way to know that this message is not a duplicate
                </div>
            </p>

            <h2>Compensating Actions</h2>
            <p>
                What happens if one of the steps of our Saga fails? For example, after reserving inventory, the <span class='inline-service'>Shipping</span> service 
                says that we do not ship this particular product to the requested destination. We currently have 
                <span class='inline-code'>InventoryReservation</span> and pending <span class='inline-code'>Order</span> entities in our other services, and 
                they need to be removed. To do so, messages can be sent to each respective service to remove the corresponding resources, these messages
                are better known as compensating actions. For each step in a Saga that persists data or changes state, there must be a compensating action. 
                If any step in the Saga fails, then all previously successful steps must be compensated. 

                <div class='sidenote'>
                    It might at first seem adventageous to send out all Saga steps in parallel, to speed up the execution, although there is a problem with doing so.
                    Lets say that the <span class='inline-service'>Orders</span> service sends out a message to reserve inventory and validate shipping. 
                    at the same time. The shipping validation message comes back first, and is uncessfull. What to do? The inventory reservation message
                    cannot yet be compensated, because we don't know if it was succcessful or not! 
                </div>

            </p>



            <h2>Failed Implementations</h2>

            <p>
                Lets talk about the journey to get to the solution described above. For the code examples, I'll be using NodeJS, and NestJS, a backend framework
                which wraps express. When sitting down to implement this saga, my first thought was to implement a representation of a 
                saga in a class. It would implement a <span class='inline-code'>ISagaOrchestrator</span> interface and have a list of steps, 
                which implemented an <span class='inline-code'>ISagaStep</span> interface. Below are the example classes

<div class="container">
  <div class="interface-title">ISagaOrchestrator Interface</div>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-typescript">export interface ISagaOrchestrator {
  begin(): Promise<void>;
}</pre>
  
  <div class="interface-title">ISagaStep Interface</div>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-typescript">export interface ISagaStep {
  invoke(): Promise<void>;
  compensate(): Promise<void>;
}</pre>
  
  <div class="class-title">OrderSagaOrchestrator Class</div>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-typescript">export class OrderSagaOrchestrator implements ISagaOrchestrator<OrderSagaStep> {
  // List of steps in the saga
  constructor(private steps: ISagaStep[]) {}
  
  async begin(): Promise<void> {
    const succeededSteps: ISagaStep[] = []
    try {
      for (const step of steps) {
        const response = await step.invoke()
        if (!response.successful) {
          await compensate()
          return
        }
        succeededSteps.push(step)
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e)
      await compensate()
    }
  }
  
  private async compensate() {
    await Promise.all(succeededSteps.map(async (step) => {
      return await step.compensate()
    }))
  }
}</pre>
  
  <div class="class-title">ReserveInventoryStep Class</div>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-typescript">export class ReserveInventoryStep implements ISagaStep {
  // Example step, constructed with necessary data to send to quueue 
  constructor(
    private rabbitMQService: RMQService,
    private productId: number,
    private quantity: number
  ) {}
  
  /* Send reserve inventory message, and wait for response. 
  Do not advance Saga until we get a response */
  invoke(): Promise<void> {
    await this.rabbitMQService.sendReserveInventoryMessage(productId, quantity) 
    return await this.rabbitMQService.listenForReserveInventoryResponse()
  }
  
  compensate(): Promise<void> {
    await this.rabbitMQService.compensateReserveInventoryMesssage(productId, quantity)
  }
}
... other steps</pre>


                At a first glance, I felt pretty good about this. Once a message came in, I would write the <span class='inline-code'>Order</span> 
                Entity and the <span class='inline-code'>InventoryReserve</span> message to the database. Then, every 5 seconds I would poll the outbox 
                for new messages. If any were found, I would create a Saga with the needed steps, add it to the <span class='inline-code'>activeSagas</span>
                array in the service class, and simply call the begin() method to kick off the first message and delete the message from the outbox. The saga
                itself listened on the corresponding response queues for incomming messages. This seemed great, until I noticed a pretty big flaw.
            </p>

            <p>
                To explain the issue, I'll give an example. Lets say that we recieve two incomming HTTP requests to the <span class='inline-service'>Orders</span>
                service, which kicks off two sagas: Saga1 and Saga2. Saga1 and Saga2 both send out messages to the 
                to reserve inventory, and call the <span class='inline-code'>this.rabbitMQService.listenFoReserveInventoryResponse()</span> method, 
                meaning that they both are waiting for a message to come back on the same queue. This is known as the competing consumer pattern, 
                and can be great in some cases. A response will come to the queue, and either Saga1 or Saga2 can get the message, but only one of them. 
                In some cases, this allows for essentially multithreading functionality. But in our scenario, 
                it creates the possibility for a Saga to recieve the responses meant for another Saga. If Saga1's inventory request was denied but Saga2's wans't,
                Saga1 could recieve an successful message while Saga2 recieved the rejected message. 
            </p>

            <p>
                How can we remedy this? We need one sort of "global" listener per response queue, and we need to be able to route it to the specific Saga 
                it belongs to. I decided to create a map, from the unique ID of each <span class='inline-code'>Order</span> Entity to saga and attach the 
                ID to the message. When a message comes back, we will simply look up the saga in the map, and call next step.

                Finally, we reach the problem which made me completely redesign the code: A orchestrator server crash. If the orchestration server (in this case, 
                the server hosting the <span class='inline-service'>Orders</span> service) crashes with active sagas, then we have messages that are going to 
                eventually come back to the <span class='inline-service'>Orders</span> service, with no corresponding saga. This means that
                we have to reconstruct the Sagas each time the application restarts, so that we can handle crashes properly. This could be done by looking at 
                all currently pending orders upon server restart and constructing a saga from them, but it was beginning to feel over-engineered. 
                Rather, I ended up going a much simpler route. I created message handlers for each response queue, and I attached the ID of each 
                <span class='inline-code'>Order</span> Entity to every message to every service. This way, when the order
                service got a message, it could simply look up the <span class='inline-code'>Order</span> Entity details from the database, craft the next message 
                with the data it got from the database, and then send it to the corresponding channel.

            Below is a link to a Github repository with the code implementation for the final solution. It utilizes NestJS, and dockerized
            Postgres and RabbitMQ instances. I was too lazy to configure a .env, so please clear off ports 3000, 3001, 3002, 1000, 1001, and 5672 if you want 
            to run it. I have also provided a .http file for ease of use.
