			<h2>Brief Recap</h2>
            <p>
				This will be a continuation of my other post about sagas, which can be found
				<a href="https://jack-gitter.github.io/posts/sagas/sagas-outbox-idempotency.html">here</a>.
				Although the implementation worked, I was not extremely satisfied with the code itself.
				That implementation started with an orchestration based saga, but reverted to a
				choreography based approach due to the difficulties of dealing with an orchestration server crash.
				For this implementation, I've decided to utilize all of the same robustness techniques, although
				rework my classes and code organization into a more modular and clean approach.

			<h2>General Patterns, High Level Overview</h2>
			The main patterns used to communicate between microservices  are: saga, idempotent consumer, and outbox. 
			If you're not up to speed on one or any of these, my previous 
			<a href="https://jack-gitter.github.io/posts/sagas/sagas-outbox-idempotency.html">post</a> goes into
			great detail about them. More information can also be found <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/">here</a>. I also use some simple OOP patterns, such as 
			the factory pattern and builder pattern.
