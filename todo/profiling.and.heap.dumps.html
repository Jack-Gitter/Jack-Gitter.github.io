write a post about using clinic.js in order to get performance analysis on nodejs applications
	* simulate a memory leak
	* simulate a cpu bottleneck and identify via flame graphs
	* show a blocking event loop (same as above)
write a post about finding memroy leaks in nodejs, using browser as a profiler to compare heap dumps
	* how they can even happen with a GC language?
	* how to generate a dump
	* how to compare with browser


* maybe make it a general profiler blog post?
