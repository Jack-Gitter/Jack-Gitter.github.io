id tokens vs access tokens and refresh tokens

oauth general flow

oauth 

wrapping oauth info with own JWT

what are idps good for

local vs provided access tokens

odic for authentication, oauth for authorization

oauth for authorization, scopes on the login to see what user has access to

different ways to implement auth with an IDP, using backend SDKs vs Headless frontend SDK vs full on frontend UI components

benefits of using an idp, 
    groups, extra user information, session management

what the hell is SAML, how does it differ from oauth -- saml talks directly to the IDP, and configures stuff in there

IDP initiated sso vs SP init sso

SAML vs OIDC -- used for SSO, to authenticate a user and let them sign into an application. Talks directly between service provider and IDP to allow user

oauth and oidc for SSO with graphana and keycloak
