id tokens vs access tokens and refresh tokens
oauth general flow
oauth vs auth0
what are idps good for
oidc
local vs provided access tokens
odic for authentication, no scopes on the login
oauth for authorization, scopes on the login
pure backend auth vs involving the frontend, custom components vs builtin given components, etc
benefits of using an idp, groups, extra user information, session management
what the hell is SAML, how does it differ from oauth -- saml talks directly to the IDP, and configures stuff in there
