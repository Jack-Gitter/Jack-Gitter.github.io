two phase commit --> 

talk about write ahead logs 
talk about failure cases
talk about why its needed
talk about drawbacks
talk about differences between eventual consistency and this

* generate a transaction id, write it to the coordinator db and say what databases its happening with
* begin the transactions and do the prepare statement with the id that was written to the database
* then commit after getting the OK from both, or rollback

* if we go down before starting the transaction, maybe we'll have to see if there is a way to see if there is an existing prepared trasnaction with the id, otherwise
	start from the top

	* also need to write the responses back from the individual dbs, so that it knows what to do when it comes back up
